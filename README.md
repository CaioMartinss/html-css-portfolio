# Portfolio 🌟

This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
website showcases my skills and experience as a front-end developer, including
my projects, education, and work experience. The objective of this website is to
provide potential employers and collaborators with an overview of my skills and
interests, as well as a sense of my design style and coding ability.
